A local-first **prompt crafting studio** for AI image and video generation. It runs on your Ollama backend and ships quantized Qwen2.5 and Llama 3.2 text models for fast, hardware-friendly prompt ideation. You can also feed in an image and let Qwen2.5-VL draft prompts.

---

## 📚 Overview

Arctic Prompter keeps everything on-device: Ollama handles the inference, quantized models keep usage light, and the UI guides you from idea to ready-to-run prompts for images or videos. Swap between Qwen2.5 and Llama 3.2 for different writing styles, or use Qwen2.5-VL to turn reference images into structured prompts.

---

## 🧩 Core Features

- 🧠 **Ollama-powered prompting** using quantized Qwen2.5 and Llama 3.2 for responsive, on-device text generation.
- 🖼️ **Image-to-prompt with Qwen2.5-VL** to convert reference images into ready-to-tweak prompts.
- 🎬 **Image + video prompt flows** with guidance to keep outputs consistent across modalities.
- 🌡️ **Thermal monitor** that surfaces CPU/GPU temps so you know when to pause or switch models.
- 🕒 **Keep-alive toggle** to hold a model in memory for long sessions; turn it off if you’re switching models frequently.
- ⚡ **Hardware-friendly defaults**—all bundled models are quantized to run smoothly on most machines.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download the latest `.flatpak`** from this repo’s Releases page.
2. Install it:
   ```bash
   sudo flatpak install ArcticPrompter.flatpak
   ```

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Active internet connection (for pulling LLM models and downloading the Ollama backend).
- Flatpak runtime on your system:

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint
  sudo apt install flatpak

  # Fedora (already included on Workstation editions)
  sudo dnf install flatpak

  # Arch / Manjaro
  sudo pacman -S flatpak
  ```

- If you previously ran <https://github.com/ArcticLatent/post-linux>, you already have the required runtimes and codecs.

---

## 📁 Download Locations

- When you first launch the app, the Ollama binary automatically downloads and installs to `~/.local/share/arcticprompter/ollama`.
- LLM models download into `~/.local/share/arcticprompter/ollama/models/blobs`.

---

## 💡 Usage Tips

- Start with Qwen2.5 for concise prompts; switch to Llama 3.2 when you want more verbose phrasing.
- Use Qwen2.5-VL when you have a reference image—drag and drop the image into the app or upload an image by clicking import image.
